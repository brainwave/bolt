STL Parser - 1.0.0  (Moduleno.Majorversion.Minorversion)

	Library for parsing ASCII and Binary STL Files
	Includes functionality for creating Triangle Mesh


TO DO
	File not being read correctly, need to sort out the IEEE specification for STL
	
	Check for endianness, make code portable
	Add support for ASCII Files	
	Restrict file read (to determine ascii) to a few kilobytes instead of the full file (efficiency improvement)
