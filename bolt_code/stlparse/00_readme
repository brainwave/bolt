STL Parser - 1.0.0  (Moduleno.Majorversion.Minorversion)

	Library for parsing ASCII and Binary STL Files
	Includes functionality for creating Triangle Mesh

	Implemented binary/ASCII detection

	Sorted ASCII file being incorrectly read

TO DO

	Check if binary file is correctly read, implement fix if needed
	Check for endianness, make code portable
	Restrict file read (to determine ascii) to a few kilobytes instead of the full file (efficiency improvement)
	Check for intersections only in small volume above and below each triangle, or use only triangles a certain volume and down a given Z
	Improve intersection code to add the edge cases
